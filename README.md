# JospehusCircle

This class is a framework for the implementation of the
Josephus-Problem (aka Josephus' Circle, Josephus Algorithm, or Enny Meeny Miney Moe).

Titus Flavius Josephus was an important historian in the first century.
He survived the occupation and destruction of Jerusalem in 70 AD
and began writing many accounts on the history of Judaism. His work remains an important source of knowledge about the Jewish faith until now.
and show a non-biblical view on early Christianity. But also his other work contribute significantly
to historical sciences. For example, he tells the story about how he escaped certain death
-- just by being at the right time in the right place: play the game of eeny meeny miney moe.

Legend has it that Josephus and 40 soldiers fled from occupation through the toman empire and hid in caves in the mountains. Surrounded by
Roman legions, they saw now way out except -- of course -- to kill themselves. Just like Klingons,
they thought it better to be dead than to be imprisoned.

In order to decide who shall kill themselves when, the soldiers stood in a circle
and started counting clockwise at a random position. They counted to 3
and the dude at position 3 took the ax and did what needed to be done.
The soldiers reset to zero and kept counting, with every third soldiers doing his duty...
until only one more soldiers remained.<br>
Josephus wasn't so keen on offing himself, so he thought of the perfect way of staying alive! He quickly figured out
what the last position to be counted to was - and simply stood there. That way, he ensured that he would be
the last man standing.
